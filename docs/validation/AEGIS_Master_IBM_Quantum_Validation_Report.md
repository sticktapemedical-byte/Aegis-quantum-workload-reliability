# AEGIS IBM Quantum Validation Report

Generated from real IBM Quantum Runtime jobs executed on May 28, 2026.

## Scope Boundary

These results summarize real IBM Quantum backend jobs whose raw hardware counts were ingested by the AEGIS site reliability control-plane simulation framework. AEGIS performs classical post-processing, telemetry mapping, continuity/setpoint governance, compact 176-bit `.QOM` frame generation, and Merkle lineage logging over returned count histograms.

They are not presented as a broad benchmark of IBM hardware, a device calibration result, or evidence that AEGIS changes physical quantum noise. The hardware executes the circuits; AEGIS governs and records the returned data path.

## Current Execution Model

AEGIS currently runs after each IBM Quantum job or batch returns. IBM Quantum Runtime executes the circuit, then AEGIS ingests the returned count histograms and performs classical post-processing, governance, `.QOM` serialization, and Merkle lineage.

This is not real-time QPU control. The near-term bridge path is session-based batching: keep IBM Runtime resources warm, submit short circuit batches, and run AEGIS immediately after each batch result returns.

Implemented session-batch example: `examples/session_batch_loop.py`.

Local smoke result: `3` fake-backend batches, `128` shots per batch, mean GHZ population `95.31%`, mean `q_conf=0.96148`, and `3/3` continuity gates passed. This validates the batch-loop integration path without spending additional real-hardware quota.

## Executive Rollup

| Category | Value |
|---|---:|
| Real backend jobs represented | 15 |
| IBM backends used | `ibm_marrakesh`, `ibm_kingston`, `ibm_fez` |
| Total shots represented | 25,984 |
| Multi-backend GHZ devices tested | 3 |
| Corrected setpoint validations | 15 / 15 |
| Compact `.QOM` frame width | 176 bits |

## Statistical Rigor Note

This is an early end-to-end validation set. The 15 hardware jobs prove that the bridge can execute, ingest, score, serialize, and ledger real backend results. They do not establish device-level performance claims.

Most individual runs use 128 to 512 shots, with one 1024-shot GHZ run, one 4096-shot GHZ run, two 1280-shot phase-sweep jobs, and one 5120-shot high-resolution setpoint sweep. Stronger future studies should add:

- more repeated runs per backend and condition,
- higher shot counts where account limits permit,
- confidence intervals for GHZ population and setpoint error,
- contemporaneous backend calibration snapshots,
- separated analysis for readout error, gate error, queue latency, and control-plane decisions.

## Highlights

- Multi-backend GHZ ingestion completed across `ibm_marrakesh`, `ibm_kingston`, and `ibm_fez`.
- All GHZ bridge runs generated valid 176-bit `.QOM` metadata frames and Merkle lineage roots.
- The 1 ms idle-delay GHZ stress run stayed in `NORMAL` governance and passed continuity.
- The first continuous phase sweep intentionally failed closed under apparent anchor drift, exercising fail-closed behavior.
- The corrected commanded-setpoint sweeps passed all setpoint checks after the test declared each phase as an intentional calibration target.
- The 4096-shot GHZ run produced `95.19%` target-state population and passed continuity under `NORMAL` governance.
- The 1024-shot-per-phase setpoint sweep passed `5/5` commanded setpoints with mean absolute error `0.0043`.
- The readout mitigation comparison improved target-state mass from `95.41%` raw to `96.86%` after local assignment-matrix mitigation; AEGIS separately governed the raw data path.
- The corrected VQE-style scan passed `3/3` declared variational setpoints and produced valid `.QOM`/Merkle records.
- The cross-depth stress run intentionally produced high-error outputs and the control plane refused continuity passes while still recording lineage.

## Technical Breakdown

1. IBM Quantum Runtime returned raw bitstring count histograms from real backend jobs.
2. GHZ tests classified target-state mass as `counts(0000) + counts(1111)`.
3. Single-qubit phase tests compared observed `P(1)` against the commanded model `P(1)=sin^2(theta/2)`.
4. AEGIS mapped counts into telemetry lanes with phase estimates, environment pressure, latency, and trust inputs.
5. The kernel executed projection, wrapped-delta phase unwrapping, quorum/anchor checks, governance bitmask evaluation, compact `.QOM` emission, and Merkle commit.
6. Continuous trajectory tests and commanded setpoint tests are intentionally separated: continuity gates are strict trajectory-corridor checks, while setpoint validation checks whether declared calibration targets were matched.
7. The compact `.QOM` payload is implemented in `AegisContinuityKernel.emit_compact_qom_payload(...)` using `struct.pack(">IHHHHHQ", ...)`, producing exactly 22 bytes / 176 bits. `tests/test_kernel.py::test_qom_compact_payload_is_exact_176_bit_struct` unpacks the emitted bytes and validates the field boundaries.
8. The readout mitigation comparison uses local per-qubit assignment matrices estimated from calibration circuits. It is a basic classical mitigation baseline, separate from AEGIS governance.
9. The VQE-style scan uses a small two-qubit ansatz and toy H2 Hamiltonian expectation model to validate optimization-style circuit ingestion.
10. `docs/validation/baseline_comparison.json` summarizes raw GHZ, AEGIS-governed GHZ, basic readout mitigation uplift, and setpoint pass-rate metrics generated from the sanitized artifact vault.

## Local Artifacts

Raw JSON outputs and generated PDFs remain on the local workstation and are intentionally ignored by Git. This keeps the public repository clean while preserving forensic records locally.

## Adaptive Validation Readiness

The repository now includes a second-stage orchestration layer for the next IBM backend campaign:

- `examples/accepted_vs_rejected.py`: runs session-style or fallback batch jobs and compares all, accepted, and rejected quality groups. It supports an explicit `--accept-threshold` so the study can produce a meaningful rejected cohort when continuity gates alone pass all batches.
- `examples/delay_ramp.py`: runs GHZ jobs with configurable idle delays to detect degradation in returned target-state populations.
- `examples/readout_mitigation_repeat.py`: repeats raw-vs-basic-readout-mitigation comparisons. Without `--real`, it prints a dry-run quota plan and does not submit jobs.
- `examples/adaptive_backend_selector.py`: probes candidate backends, scores each backend using GHZ population, `q_conf`, latency, and error risk, then commits one selected workload to the best candidate.
- `examples/efficiency_report.py`: summarizes shots per accepted artifact and mean accepted GHZ from the sanitized validation vault.

The real backend command list is maintained in `docs/adaptive_validation_plan.md`. These scripts are prepared for multiple real backend tests, but they are not executed automatically because they spend IBM Quantum runtime and may wait in a public queue.
