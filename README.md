# AEGIS Site Reliability Control-Plane Simulation Framework

> **Scope in one sentence:** AEGIS is a site reliability control-plane simulation framework for probabilistic telemetry and quantum-inspired hardware-interface research. It performs classical post-processing, governance, serialization, and lineage over observed data. It is not a physical quantum operating system, not a hardware product, and not a claim that software changes device-level quantum noise.

## What This Is / What This Is Not

| This repository is | This repository is not |
|---|---|
| A Python simulation framework for reliability governance around probabilistic telemetry. | A physical quantum operating system or deployed hardware controller. |
| A reference implementation of reliability control-plane ideas: observability, gating, fail-closed states, lineage, and reviewer metrics. | A claim that software removes, suppresses, or physically alters quantum noise. |
| A reproducible benchmark harness with tests, Monte Carlo runs, Qiskit bridge examples, and JSON artifacts. | A validated production deployment on real quantum hardware. |
| A noncommercial research/portfolio codebase with commercial licensing reserved separately. | A permission grant for commercial platform integration. |

For technical review, read the claims as **simulation claims unless a section explicitly says otherwise**. See `VALIDATION.md`, `ASSUMPTIONS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `docs/runtime_boundaries.md` for grounding boundaries.

## Executive Summary

AEGIS explores a site reliability engineering approach for operating high-entropy probabilistic systems with classical reliability controls. The project uses “Q-SRE” as shorthand for that research direction, but the implemented artifact is a simulation framework.

AEGIS is the reference implementation: a control plane and simulation framework for mediating probabilistic hardware interfaces. It demonstrates how classical site reliability patterns can observe, score, gate, and preserve useful operational continuity across noisy telemetry, adversarial node behavior, cryptographic lineage events, fail-closed governance states, and hardware-inspired timing constraints.

Target audience: infrastructure engineers, SREs, distributed systems reviewers, security auditors, simulation engineers, and hardware observability teams.

Scope note: this is a software simulation and control-plane framework. It does not claim to physically modify quantum hardware, erase physical noise, or bypass known limits of quantum mechanics. Its core claim is classical software-mediated unsafe-output prevention, observability, containment, serialization, and reproducible artifact generation around probabilistic telemetry.

## Core Technical Metrics

Current public simulation metrics from the repository's synthetic benchmark suite:

- Unsafe-Output Prevention Efficiency, `UOP_eff`: `99.63%`
- Unnecessary Shutdown Rate, `USR`: `0.00%`
- Telemetry compression model ratio: `14.2x`
- Compact `.QOM` metadata frame: `176 bits`
- Public v1 UOP target: `99.49%`
- Systemic stretch UOP target: `99.90%`
- Theoretical cascade boundary target: `99.925%`

Observed synthetic cascade variance reductions:

- Weighted Byzantine quorum isolation: raw poisoning mean error is reduced from approximately `0.3940` to `0.0188`.
- Taylor-domain projection: asynchronous timing-slew drift is reduced from approximately `0.0633` to `0.0055`.
- Wrapped-delta phase unwrapping: wrapped phase-cut acceleration variance is reduced from approximately `0.2354` to `8.09e-08` in synthetic trials.

## Real Hardware Validation: IBM Quantum Runtime

On May 28, 2026, the optional IBM bridge executed a short validation set on real IBM Quantum hardware. The full ledger is stored at [`docs/validation/AEGIS_Master_IBM_Quantum_Validation_Report.md`](docs/validation/AEGIS_Master_IBM_Quantum_Validation_Report.md).

This is a real ingestion and governance test against noisy hardware output. AEGIS does classical post-processing of IBM count histograms after execution. It is not presented as a broad benchmark of IBM hardware, not a calibration claim, and not evidence that the software changes physical device noise.

Master ledger highlights:

- Backends used: `ibm_marrakesh`, `ibm_kingston`, `ibm_fez`
- Total real hardware shots represented: `6,016` across short validation jobs
- Initial 4-qubit GHZ run on `ibm_marrakesh`: `94.24%` GHZ population (`965/1024` shots)
- Same-backend repeatability run on `ibm_marrakesh`: `96.09%` GHZ population (`492/512` shots)
- Cross-device GHZ runs: `ibm_kingston` at `92.58%`, `ibm_fez` at `83.59%`
- Fast single-qubit coherence/readout pass: `q_conf=0.96972`, continuity passed, `NORMAL`
- Corrected commanded setpoint sweeps: `10/10` setpoint validations passed across 128-shot and 256-shot sweeps
- Compact `.QOM` frames generated at `176 bits` with Merkle lineage roots

Result: the AEGIS control-plane bridge successfully ingested real noisy IBM Quantum counts, converted them into the repository's telemetry schema, evaluated continuity and commanded-setpoint gates, and generated compact `.QOM` metadata frames with Merkle lineage.

Statistical rigor note: these are early, short-shot validation runs intended to prove end-to-end integration. They are not sufficient for device-level statistical claims. Stronger future studies should use more repetitions per condition, higher shot counts, confidence intervals, and controlled backend calibration snapshots.

## Runtime Failure Boundary Rules

The detailed failure-boundary notes were moved to `docs/runtime_boundaries.md` to keep the README focused. In short, the simulator models low-order fallback, phase-branch recovery, staged cryptographic sealing, fail-closed governance, and forensic branch tombstones.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10 or newer recommended
- Core simulator and monitor: no external Python dependencies
- Test runner: `pytest` recommended
- Qiskit bridge example: optional `qiskit` and `qiskit-aer`

Run the terminal simulation:

`python aegis_os.py`

Run reviewer-mode terminal output:

`python aegis_os.py --reviewer-mode`

Run tests and reviewer-mode output in one command:

`python -m pytest tests && python aegis_os.py --reviewer-mode`

Equivalent reviewer-mode toggle:

`python aegis_os.py --mode reviewer`

Environment-variable reviewer toggle:

`$env:AEGIS_REVIEWER_MODE="1"; python aegis_os.py`

Run the live monitor:

`python aegis_monitor.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765`

Open:

`http://127.0.0.1:8765`

The monitor includes a Qiskit simulator ingestion panel with live QST-style overlap fidelity, `T1`/`T2` relaxation/dephasing readouts, Qiskit noise-scale controls, a QEM calibration toggle, and a `STATE_LEAKAGE_RECON` stress mode that reports leaked channel indices and Solve-for-X reconstruction score. The panel also exposes `Run Qiskit Pass`, `Stop Qiskit Only`, `Save Qiskit JSON`, `Export Qiskit JSON`, and `Import Qiskit JSON` controls so reviewers can generate a bridge artifact, cancel only the Qiskit bridge loop without stopping the live monitor, persist it on the local server, download it, or reload a prior bridge run.

Run automated regression tests:

`python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

`python -m pytest tests/`

Run the optional Qiskit Aer bridge:

`python examples/qiskit_bridge.py`

If Qiskit is not installed, install the optional integration packages in a separate environment:

`python -m pip install -r requirements-qiskit.txt`

## Automated Testing

The `tests/` suite verifies hard safety invariants:

- Crypto invalidation: an induced key/signature slip sets `CRYPTO_SEAL`, drops the continuity gate, and closes the hardware register gate.
- Holdover breach: an elapsed tracking window beyond the safe phase-error ceiling triggers `CIRCUIT_ABORT` and marks `HOLDOVER_BREACH`.
- Phase unwrap continuity: aggressive `[-pi, +pi)` branch-cut crossings remain continuous after wrapped-delta unwrapping, with acceleration variance below `8.09e-08`.

The tests use plain Python assertions and are compatible with pytest:

`python -m pytest tests/`

## Validation and Grounding

This project is a simulation framework for reliability-governance behavior around probabilistic telemetry, not a claim of measured physical quantum hardware performance. See `VALIDATION.md` and `ASSUMPTIONS.md` for the current boundary between measured simulation results, theoretical projections, and non-modeled hardware behavior.

Grounded checks include:

- weighted Byzantine filtering against synthetic poisoned-node trials
- wrapped-delta phase unwrapping across `[-pi, pi)` branch cuts
- unsafe-output prevention across deterministic stress scenarios
- Merkle/HMAC ledger integrity checks
- `.QOM` compact payload bit-width validation

## `.QOM` Compact Payload Layout

The compact `.QOM` payload is generated as a real 22-byte big-endian binary struct in `aegis_kernel.py`, not as a JSON placeholder. The implementation is `AegisContinuityKernel.emit_compact_qom_payload(...)`:

`struct.pack(">IHHHHHQ", phase_u32, coherence_u16, lifecycle_u16, trust_u16, backaction_u16, governance_u16, opte_u64)`

That layout is:

| Field | Type | Bits |
|---|---:|---:|
| phase estimate | unsigned int | 32 |
| coherence / confidence | unsigned short | 16 |
| lifecycle epoch | unsigned short | 16 |
| trust index | unsigned short | 16 |
| backaction/risk proxy | unsigned short | 16 |
| governance bitmask | unsigned short | 16 |
| OPTE policy context prefix | unsigned long long | 64 |

Total: `176 bits`. `tests/test_kernel.py::test_qom_compact_payload_is_exact_176_bit_struct` unpacks the emitted bytes and validates the field boundaries.

## Qiskit Bridge

`examples/qiskit_bridge.py` is an optional integration example for reviewers who want to see the control plane wrap around a standard quantum simulation framework. It:

1. Builds a 4-qubit GHZ circuit.
2. Runs it on a Qiskit Aer simulator with thermal relaxation and depolarizing noise.
3. Optionally injects coherent crosstalk with parasitic `RXX`/`RZZ` operations between adjacent virtual qubits.
4. Applies monitor-controlled Qiskit noise scaling, weak-measurement efficiency, and leakage-lambda telemetry degradation.
5. Converts noisy shot counts into expectation-value telemetry.
6. Maps that telemetry into the AEGIS 5-variable environment grid and `NodeTelemetry` inputs.
7. Emits normal AEGIS cycle outputs, including governance states, `.QOM` payload bits, and Merkle lineage.

The bridge is intentionally optional so the core repository remains runnable with the Python standard library.

When the live monitor is running, the Qiskit bridge is also exposed through local HTTP endpoints:

- `POST /api/qiskit/run?cycles=6&shots=2048&seed=2026&noise_scale=1.0&crosstalk_inject=false&leakage_lambda=0.0&measurement_efficiency=0.82`: runs the optional Qiskit Aer bridge and writes `monitor_snapshots/qiskit_bridge_*.json`.
- `POST /api/qiskit/stop`: requests cancellation of the Qiskit bridge loop without stopping the live monitor, report exports, or local server.
- `GET /api/qiskit/latest`: returns the newest bridge or imported bridge artifact.
- `GET /api/qiskit/export`: returns the current bridge artifact for dashboard download.
- `POST /api/qiskit/import`: accepts a prior bridge JSON payload, stores it as `monitor_snapshots/qiskit_import_*.json`, and loads it into the monitor.

## IBM Quantum Bridge

`examples/ibm_bridge.py` is an optional bridge for IBM Quantum Runtime. It defaults to a local fake IBM backend so reviewers can validate the mapping without waiting in a cloud queue. Real hardware execution is explicit with `--real`.

Setup and operational cautions are documented in `docs/ibm_quantum_setup.md`.

Local fake-backend smoke test:

`python examples/ibm_bridge.py --shots 256 --output ibm_bridge_fake_result.json`

Real hardware, when credentials are configured locally:

`python examples/ibm_bridge.py --real --shots 1024 --output ibm_bridge_result.json`

## Algorithmic Grounding

Several AEGIS terms are project-specific names for established engineering patterns:

- **Meaning-based compression:** modeled as lossy high-utility telemetry filtering, where low-value floating-point tails and repeated sensor noise are truncated before archival. This follows common industrial telemetry compression and lossy signal-compression practice.
- **Weighted Byzantine quorum isolation:** grounded in Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed systems. AEGIS keeps the `f < n/3` mindset, requires a minimum physical node count, and weights candidate vectors by trust before medoid/outlier filtering.
- **Wrapped-delta phase unwrapping:** implemented as `wrap_pi(delta) = ((delta + pi) mod 2pi) - pi`, accumulated into a continuous track. This is aligned with PLL-style phase tracking and Itoh-style phase-unwrapping logic.
- **Unsafe-output prevention efficiency:** a reliability metric over unsafe-output opportunities, not a claim that software removes physical noise. It measures how often the control plane prevents unsafe data from reaching the output or ledger.

## JSON Export Layout

The monitor and runner export JSON payloads containing:

- `projection_validation`: public targets, stretch targets, theoretical cascade boundaries
- `observed_cascade_efficiency_estimates`: Monte Carlo-derived eta estimates and variance reductions
- `advanced_performance_report`: baseline, storm, adversarial, and fail-closed summaries
- `deterministic_suite`: scenario-by-scenario kernel cycle results
- `monte_carlo`: UOP, USR, continuity, integrity-preserved, and tier metrics
- `scope`: canonical runtime loop and active architecture module descriptions

Each live cycle result includes governance states, kappa vector mean, multiplicative trust channels, continuity gates, unsafe-output fields, Merkle root, block hash, `.QOM` payload, OPTE hash, hardware register diagnostics, secure enclave vault state, cryogenic scheduler output, reviewer telemetry, handoff slack, key lineage, energy efficiency, relativistic clock compensation, ZNE tuning, and RTOS scheduler diagnostics.
