# Aegis Quantum OS Monolith

## Executive Summary

Aegis Quantum OS Monolith introduces Quantum Site Reliability Engineering (Q-SRE) as a proposed engineering discipline for operating high-entropy probabilistic systems with classical reliability controls. AEGIS is the reference implementation: a full-stack Q-SRE control-plane simulation for mediating probabilistic hardware interfaces. It models how classical reliability engineering patterns can observe, score, gate, and preserve useful operational continuity across noisy telemetry streams, adversarial node behavior, cryptographic lineage events, and hardware-inspired timing constraints.

The project is written for infrastructure engineers, site reliability engineers, distributed systems reviewers, security auditors, and hardware observability teams who need a runnable demonstration of a continuity kernel, live telemetry monitor, stress injection deck, and forensic artifact exporter.

The simulation does not claim to modify physical qubits or bypass physics. It demonstrates a software control-plane model for unsafe-output prevention, trust scoring, fail-closed governance, telemetry fusion, and auditability around probabilistic or high-entropy systems.

## Technical Metrics

The current simulation and monitor track these benchmark classes:

- Unsafe-output prevention efficiency: measured as unsafe outputs prevented divided by unsafe-output opportunities.
- Public v1 UOP target: 0.9949.
- Systemic stretch UOP target: 0.9990.
- Theoretical cascade boundary target: 0.99925.
- Unnecessary shutdown rate target: below 0.05.
- Meaningful Continuity: reported as both raw lifespan multiplier and normalized corridor health.
- Compression ratio: reviewer telemetry reports a 14.2x data compression ratio.
- Observed cascade reductions:
  - Weighted Byzantine filtering estimates variance reduction on corrupted node vectors.
  - Taylor-domain projection estimates timing-jitter reduction.
  - Riemann phase unwrapping estimates wrapped-to-unwrapped acceleration variance suppression.
- Uptime-style scenario reporting: the terminal suite models baseline, storm, adversarial, fail-closed, and recovery-validation paths.

## Architecture Overview

### Layer 4: Network Mesh Layer

The mesh layer models decentralized data transport, live disruption injection, `.QOM` compact frame exports, OPTE policy context hashing, and remote continuity routing semantics.

### Layer 3: Regional Hub Nodes

Regional nodes model weighted quorum voting, node quarantine, rolling anchor verification, Merkle lineage, forensic certificates, and multi-branch key mutation traces.

### Layer 2: Acceleration Tier

The acceleration tier models math offload for Taylor-domain kinetic phase normalization, Riemann manifold phase unwrapping, weighted vector fusion, Monte Carlo cascade efficiency estimation, and reviewer-mode telemetry metrics.

### Layer 1: Register Abstraction

The register abstraction maps low-level gating concepts into simulated FPGA/ASIC-style diagnostics:

- `G(t)` boundary gating.
- Hardware register handoff slack.
- O-quantization timing windows.
- Relativistic timestamp compensation.
- RTOS queue depth and lockhold latency.
- Cryogenic thermal scheduling and joule-density cost.
