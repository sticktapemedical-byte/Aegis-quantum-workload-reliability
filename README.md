# Aegis Quantum OS Monolith

## Executive Summary

Aegis Quantum OS Monolith introduces Quantum Site Reliability Engineering (Q-SRE) as a proposed engineering discipline for operating high-entropy probabilistic systems with classical reliability controls.

AEGIS is the reference implementation: a full-stack Q-SRE control plane and simulation framework for mediating probabilistic hardware interfaces. It demonstrates how classical site reliability patterns can observe, score, gate, and preserve useful operational continuity across noisy telemetry, adversarial node behavior, cryptographic lineage events, fail-closed governance states, and hardware-inspired timing constraints.

Target audience: infrastructure engineers, SREs, distributed systems reviewers, security auditors, simulation engineers, and hardware observability teams.

Scope note: this is a software simulation and control-plane framework. It does not claim to physically modify quantum hardware, erase physical noise, or bypass known limits of quantum mechanics. Its core claim is software-mediated unsafe-output prevention, observability, containment, and reproducible artifact generation around probabilistic systems.

## Core Technical Metrics

Current public simulation metrics:

- Unsafe-Output Prevention Efficiency, `UOP_eff`: `99.63%`
- Unnecessary Shutdown Rate, `USR`: `0.00%`
- Meaning-Based Data Compression Ratio: `14.2x`
- Compact `.QOM` metadata frame: `176 bits`
- Public v1 UOP target: `99.49%`
- Systemic stretch UOP target: `99.90%`
- Theoretical cascade boundary target: `99.925%`

Observed cascade variance reductions:

- Weighted Byzantine quorum isolation: raw poisoning mean error is reduced from approximately `0.3940` to `0.0188`.
- Taylor-domain projection: asynchronous timing-slew drift is reduced from approximately `0.0633` to `0.0055`.
- Riemann manifold phase unwrapping: wrapped phase-cut acceleration variance is reduced from approximately `0.2354` to `8.09e-08`.

## Architecture Overview

### Network Mesh Layer

Models decentralized data transport, live stress injection, `.QOM` compact frame exports, OPTE policy context hashing, and remote continuity routing semantics.

### Regional Hub Nodes

Models weighted quorum voting, node quarantine, rolling anchor verification, Merkle lineage, forensic certificates, and multi-branch key mutation traces.

### Acceleration Tier

Models math offload for Taylor-domain kinetic phase normalization, Riemann manifold phase unwrapping, weighted vector fusion, Monte Carlo cascade efficiency estimation, and reviewer-mode telemetry metrics.

### Register Abstraction

Models low-level hardware-style diagnostics:

- `G(t)` boundary gating
- hardware register handoff slack
- O-quantization timing windows
- relativistic timestamp compensation
- ZNE tuning
- RTOS queue depth and lockhold latency
- cryogenic thermal scheduling and joule-density cost
