# Aegis Quantum OS Monolith

## Executive Summary

Aegis Quantum OS Monolith introduces Quantum Site Reliability Engineering (Q-SRE) as a proposed engineering discipline for operating high-entropy probabilistic systems with classical reliability controls.

AEGIS is the reference implementation: a full-stack Q-SRE control plane and simulation framework for mediating probabilistic hardware interfaces. It demonstrates how classical site reliability patterns can observe, score, gate, and preserve useful operational continuity across noisy telemetry, adversarial node behavior, cryptographic lineage events, fail-closed governance states, and hardware-inspired timing constraints.

Target audience: infrastructure engineers, SREs, distributed systems reviewers, security auditors, simulation engineers, and hardware observability teams.

Scope note: this is a software simulation and control-plane framework. It does not claim to physically modify quantum hardware, erase physical noise, or bypass known limits of quantum mechanics. Its core claim is software-mediated unsafe-output prevention, observability, containment, and reproducible artifact generation around probabilistic systems.

- relativistic timestamp compensation
- ZNE tuning
- RTOS queue depth and lockhold latency
- cryogenic thermal scheduling and joule-density cost

## Runtime Failure Boundary Rules

These rules define how the simulated kernel handles edge cases where timing, measurement, branch lineage, or physical resource limits become unsafe. They are documented as system design constraints for review and implementation testing.

1. **Low-order adaptive fallback when `tau_calc > Delta_t_epoch`**

   If the full second-order phase projection cannot complete within the epoch budget, the kernel drops the acceleration term and falls back to a linear velocity projection. The uncertainty radius of the active continuity corridor is widened to reflect the lower-order estimate. If calculation latency exceeds `Delta_t_epoch * n_max`, the kernel triggers `CIRCUIT_ABORT` rather than emitting a stale or hallucinated track.

2. **Backaction contamination correction when `[H, L_j] != 0`**

   The runtime separates dissipation into environmental and observer-induced components:

   `D_total = D_env + D_obs`

   When the Hamiltonian and measurement operator do not commute, the observed error is corrected by a non-commutation penalty, modeled as `alpha * ||[H, L_j]||`. Nodes under intense measurement stress are marked `BACKACTION_CONTAMINATED` instead of automatically marked `FAULTY`, preserving trust-state observability between physical sensor faults and observer-induced disturbance.

3. **Winding-number extraction through `RECOVERY_VALIDATE`**

   The kernel treats an angular update as a possible lost Riemann sheet when:

   `|Delta P| > omega_max * Delta_t_epoch + epsilon`

   or when competing branch likelihoods collide. Phase commits are frozen, and `RECOVERY_VALIDATE` resolves the valid winding number against the newest anchor reference:

   `N_valid = argmin ||P_tilde_N - A_anchor||`

   Active data paths reopen only after the rolling anchor window is re-synchronized.

4. **Deterministic resolution of `ORPHANED_FORENSIC_BRANCH`**

   During a healed network partition or branch collision, competing lineage branches are scored with a canonical branch score `S_b` that can incorporate anchor agreement, trust channels, continuity health, epoch recency, and cryptographic validity. The winning branch remains active. The losing branch is sealed as an orphaned forensic branch with a permanent tombstone hash:

   `H(orphanBranchRoot || reason || resolutionEpoch)`

   Live subkeys for the losing branch are erased while the tombstone preserves non-repudiation proof.

5. **Staged cryptographic sealing with `CRYPTO_SEAL_MIN`**

   When cryptographic sealing is required under thermal pressure, the kernel first enters a minimum sealing state: freeze external I/O, lock enclaves read-only, and ratchet forward once. Heavy cache shredding is deferred until thermal headroom is available. This preserves lineage integrity without worsening a simulated cryogenic or thermal overload condition.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.10 or newer recommended
- Core simulator and monitor: no external Python dependencies
- Test runner: `pytest` recommended
- Qiskit bridge example: optional `qiskit` and `qiskit-aer`

Run the terminal simulation:

`python aegis_os.py`

Run reviewer-mode terminal output:

`python aegis_os.py --reviewer-mode`

Equivalent reviewer-mode toggle:

`python aegis_os.py --mode reviewer`

Environment-variable reviewer toggle:

`$env:AEGIS_REVIEWER_MODE="1"; python aegis_os.py`

Run the live monitor:

`python aegis_monitor.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765`

Open:

`http://127.0.0.1:8765`

Run automated regression tests:

`python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`

`python -m pytest tests/`

Run the optional Qiskit Aer bridge:

`python examples/qiskit_bridge.py`

If Qiskit is not installed, install the optional integration packages in a separate environment:

`python -m pip install -r requirements-qiskit.txt`

## Repository File Map

## Automated Testing

The `tests/` suite verifies hard safety invariants:

- Crypto invalidation: an induced key/signature slip sets `CRYPTO_SEAL`, drops the continuity gate, and closes the hardware register gate.
- Holdover breach: an elapsed tracking window beyond the safe phase-error ceiling triggers `CIRCUIT_ABORT` and marks `HOLDOVER_BREACH`.
- Riemann unwrap continuity: aggressive `[-pi, +pi)` branch-cut crossings remain continuous after wrapped-delta unwrapping, with acceleration variance below `8.09e-08`.

The tests use plain Python assertions and are compatible with pytest:

`python -m pytest tests/`

## Qiskit Bridge

`examples/qiskit_bridge.py` is an optional integration example for reviewers who want to see the control plane wrap around a standard quantum simulation framework. It:

1. Builds a 4-qubit GHZ circuit.
2. Runs it on a Qiskit Aer simulator with thermal relaxation and depolarizing noise.
3. Converts noisy shot counts into expectation-value telemetry.
4. Maps that telemetry into the AEGIS 5-variable environment grid and `NodeTelemetry` inputs.
5. Emits normal AEGIS cycle outputs, including governance states, `.QOM` payload bits, and Merkle lineage.

The bridge is intentionally optional so the core repository remains runnable with the Python standard library.

## Algorithmic Grounding

Several AEGIS terms are project-specific names for established engineering patterns:

- **Meaning-based compression:** modeled as lossy high-utility telemetry filtering, where low-value floating-point tails and repeated sensor noise are truncated before archival. This follows common industrial telemetry compression and lossy signal-compression practice.
- **Weighted Byzantine quorum isolation:** grounded in Byzantine fault-tolerant distributed systems. AEGIS keeps the `f < n/3` mindset, requires a minimum physical node count, and weights candidate vectors by trust before medoid/outlier filtering.
- **Riemann manifold phase unwrapping:** implemented as wrapped-delta phase unwrapping: `wrap_pi(delta) = ((delta + pi) mod 2pi) - pi`, accumulated into a continuous track. This is aligned with PLL-style phase tracking and Itoh-style phase-unwrapping logic.
- **Unsafe-output prevention efficiency:** a reliability metric over unsafe-output opportunities, not a claim that software removes physical noise. It measures how often the control plane prevents unsafe data from reaching the output or ledger.

## JSON Export Layout
